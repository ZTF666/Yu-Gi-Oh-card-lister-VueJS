# YuGiOh card lister

Another iteration of my old project which was a bit messy .
This spa consumes the ygoprodeck api .
I'm not caching pictures , if you want to build on upon this , try and cach the images .

<details>
this is why :<p> 'Please download and store all data pulled from this API locally to keep the amount of API calls used to a minimum.</p>
<p> Failure to do so may result in either your IP address being blacklisted or the API being rolled back. '</p>
